I like the proposed project of implementing and optimizing n-body simulation on CUDA. 
I wonder which three NVIDA cards will be used in your n-body code optimization. Do you have access to those cards? 
Performance optimization could be complex. I recommend you start with a reference about general CUDA performance optimization titled
  "Optimization Principles and Application Performance Evaluation of a Multithreaded GPU Using CUDA" by Ryoo et al. 
and a reference with more specifics about 
N-body http://cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/tutorials/COT5/slides.pptx. The author is my collaborator and has optimized version of N-body simulation.
