# n-body
This project is an implementation of an n-body simulation for my parallel class.

# Timeline and Targets:
1. ~~Create OpenGL particle model.~~
2. Implement near-brute-force n-body simulation, using CUDA.
3. Add conditional optimizations to target simulation for different GPUs.
4. Analyze performance optimizations.
